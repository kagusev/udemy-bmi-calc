<h1> BMI Calculator</h1>


## Description:
  This is learning exercise - I'm building it while learning HTML, JavaScript Node JS  and Express JS. The base for this app is code challenge from Udemy's "The Complete Web Developlent Bootcamp" course by @yu_angela. The app will calculate the BMI based on entered data. <p> 
  bmicalculator.html -  has HTML form for data entry<br>
  calculator.js - back end where calculation happens
  

## How to Run: 
  Copy the project on local machine and use IDE of your choise that incudes a web server.   

## Roadmap for future improvement:
 1. Update the entry form allowing data entry in imperial measurement system.
 2. BMI should be output below the input form (currently it goes on blank page)
 3. Add categories for BMI brackets like: "Your Body Mass Index is 24.6. This is considered normal." - "Normal" is based on calculated value
